I'm Kara ☺️ I'm a fourth year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo 📚.   
I'm currently completing a Backend Engineering internship at Faire, and have previously interned at **Meta**, **Shopify** (x2), **Capital One** and **OpenText**. I'm currently seeking full time SWE opportunities beginning after May 2023.
